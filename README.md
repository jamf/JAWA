JAWA allows an IT Administrator to focus on providing the best end user experience through automation.

## What is JAWA?

JAWA, the Jamf Automation and Webhook Assistant, is a web server designed to streamline automation workflows with Jamf Pro and other services. It features a webhook receiver for real-time automation and a crontab for scheduled script execution and report generation. JAWA simplifies the creation of time-saving workflows for Jamf Pro admins, providing a user-friendly framework to connect multiple services seamlessly within an organization.
